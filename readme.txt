------------------------- TECHNICAL/FOR MODDERS/MISC -------------------------


No vanilla functions are overwritten but constructions like

local vanilla_Function = vanillaFunction
function vanillaFunction()

  --[[ new code ]]--

  vanilla_Function() -- execute vanilla code

  --[[ new code ]]--
end

are used to modify vanilla functions. The mod only modifies some functions from vanilla client/ISUI/ISColorPickerHSB.lua.
